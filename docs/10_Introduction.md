## Why?

The sqlite functions came to life after writing the ini bash functions which parses
an in file with sqlite table definitions. This was a chance to abstract the sqlite
database.

What is useful around that?

* I want to handle a data row as a hash with keys of a table column
* I want CRUD functions to be available for a table
